    "- Looking only at the descriptions compared to the subtitles, the use of subtitles might lead to slightly better recommendations. \n",
    "- When other features were added (genre, director and cast), the results varied greatly. Sometimes the descriptions + features even gave better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be useful to use longer summaries of the films instead of the descriptions or subtitles. These could be taken from Wikipedia, for example. This would leave less room for errors, as we have seen with the very short descriptions in the first notebook. At the same time, this could lead to better results than using subtitles, as the plot is better summarised and also includes actions instead of just spoken words."
